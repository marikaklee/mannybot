yesterday was fun
i went to an event
at planet granite
where you find 
another person
at the gym 
that has
a yellow band on
and then
you belay
him or her
and vice versa.
i was able to do
many 5.11s
and i’m proud of myself.
i also met
many cool people there
and made
new climbing 
partners friends!
the climbers
were all varied in levels
there was a raffle
in the end 
for a planet granite t-shirt
unfortunately i didn’t win
but my coworker did! 
we also had yummy pizza
in the end.
i got pineapple flavor.
i will keep going 
to these events
until one day
i get my t-shirt
teehee
